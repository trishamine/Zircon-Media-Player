# Zircon Media Player

Zircon is an open-source music player for Android devices, supporting versions from Android 4.4 (KitKat) up to Android 15.

Originally created for my personal tablet running Android 4.4, Zircon has proven to work well on modern devices too (tested on Android 4.4, Android 14 and Android 15).
